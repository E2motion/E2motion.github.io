<p>Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interaction between them. It's a fundamental science that seeks to understand how the universe works, from the smallest particles to the largest structures. Physics is used to explain the behavior of the natural world and to develop new technologies that benefit society. It's a fascinating field that can lead to a wide range of career opportunities.
