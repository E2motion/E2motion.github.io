<h6 class="Roster3">BASKETBALL PROGRAM STRUCTURE</h6>

<ul class="Roster3">
   <li> IMG Academy’s basketball program focuses on position-specific instruction, a competitive schedule, year-round training and development, and frequent communication and evaluations for student-athletes and their families regarding their progress. IMG basketball features a variety of teams at various levels and age ranges to ensure each student-athlete has an enriching experience while competing against teams that will further develop their potential.</li>
   <li>
       With as much of an emphasis placed on academics and college placement as on athletic development, IMG Academy student-athletes will have access to a support team inclusive of teachers, college placement advisors, and more to ensure that they’re pursing their passions both on and off the court. IMG’s basketball program also has an extensive network of collegiate programs which provides student-athletes with exposure unlike anywhere else.
   </li>
   <li>
       During pre-season, student-athletes undergo an NBA-style combine testing evaluation to determine their current level as well as their strengths and areas in need of development. IMG places a significant emphasis on strength and conditioning during this time before progressing towards game preparation and team strategies during the season. Throughout the year, coaches place an emphasis on individual skill development, small group training, and team workouts and instruction. Once the season concludes during June-August, student-athletes can take advantage of summer school, team training options, and innovative on-court programming to further prepare for the upcoming season.
